# Sailing-Team-Iventory-System
SaaS inventory tracker for the Texas A&amp;M Sailing Team

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

```
Docker
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Use the Dockerfile to build the image

```
docker build -f Dockerfile -t profane:latest .
```

Create a container with the repo mounted and a port opened for local testing.
Fill in <BLANK> where appropriate. Exit out of the container, find the container-id
and use that to log back into the container

```
docker run -it -v <path_to>/Sailing-Team-Iventory-System:/Sailing-Team-Iventory-System -p 3000:3000 profane:latest
exit
docker ps -a | grep profane 
docker start <container-id>
docker exec -it <container-id> bash
```

Navigate to the repo in the container and run...
```
bundle install --without production
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed
rails s -p 3000 -b 0.0.0.0
```

Go to [localhost](http://localhost:3000) to see the site
